# Handwriting Recognition with CNN

## Introduction
I have developed two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for handwriting recognition, one using my own implementation and the other using TensorFlow. The final CNN is demonstrated using Tkinter, where you can enter any handwritten text (preferably using MS Paint) and my program will output a .txt file using the CNN.

The full documentation for my product, including citations and inspirations, can be found in the repository.

## Libraries Used
**Note**: For development, I highly recommend the Spyder IDE (Anaconda), especially if you are reformatting the MNIST dataset as its variable explorer is very useful.

- OpenCV (cv2): To install, run `pip install cv2` in the command prompt.
- Tkinter (part of the standard library)
- NumPy: To install, run `pip install numpy` in the command prompt.
- Pillow (PIL): To install, run `pip install pillow` in the command prompt.
- SciPy: To install, run `pip install scipy` in the command prompt.
- Matplotlib: To install, run `pip install matplotlib` in the command prompt.
- Tensorflow: To install, run `pip install tensorflow` in the command prompt.

## How to Use
To use the handwriting recognition program, run the `finalGUI.py` file. This will open the GUI where you can input your handwritten text.

## More Information
For more information on the development process of the neural network, see the `MLdocumentation.docx` file in the repository.
